Core to the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses is that the book of Genesis is 100% historical fact. That all creatures were individually created by God and that humans are special among all other life.

However during the scientific revolution of the 1800s, the discovery of Evolution lead many to question this view. Today, many religious group have been able to reconcile evolution with their religious beliefs. But there are still those who dogmatically maintain the Bible 100% historically accurate despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.

Because of this, groups like Watchtower have produced books, brochures and videos all trying to "debunk" evolution. Books, brochures and videos that are full of misinformation, misquotes, logical fallacies and very idiotic arguments.

In this, I'll like to go over the two most popular brochures JWs have on evolution **" [Was Life Created?](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/was-life-created/)"** and **" [The Origin of Life —An Answer Worth Considering](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g201501/origin-of-life)"**  and go over what they get wrong.


# [Was life Created- Evolution—Myths and Facts](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/was-life-created/evolution-myths-and-facts/)

```
Mutations provide the raw materials needed to create new species. The teaching of macroevolution is built on the claim that mutations—random changes in the genetic code of plants and animals—can produce not only new species but also entirely new families of plants and animals.
```
`
Evolution is not built on this claim. Evolution is the observation that organisms change over time. The theory of evolution is explanation how these changes occur. Whether by mutation or some other method evolution will still be true. Even if it was proven that Newton’s theory was wrong things would still fall down.

```
Wolf-Ekkehard Lönnig, a scientist from the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Germany. [*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/was-life-created/evolution-myths-and-facts/#footnote4) Why the euphoria? Lönnig, who has spent some 30 years studying mutation genetics in plants, said: “These researchers thought that the time had come to revolutionize the traditional method  of breeding plants and animals. They thought that by inducing and selecting favorable mutations, they could produce new and better plants and animals.”
```

Wolf-Ekkehard Lönnig has long been discredited.  The paper they cite was never peer reviewed and wasn’t publish in any scientific journal, yet Watchtower thinks this paper is a credible source.

```
If highly trained scientists are unable to produce new species by artificially inducing and selecting favorable mutations, is it likely that an unintelligent process would do a better job? If research shows that mutations cannot transform an original species into an entirely new one, then how, exactly, was macroevolution supposed to have taken place?
```

Scientists have produced new species though.

![Flies](https://github.com/Beerman595692/BlogPosts/blob/main/Media/evolution/Screenshot%202025-01-10%20at%2021-59-45%20What%20JW%20Get%20Wrong%20About%20Evolution.pdf.png?raw=true)

If they cannot breed with each other they
are a different species

```
Darwin believed that what he called natural selection would favor those life-forms
best suited to the environment, whereas less suitable life-forms would eventually
die off. Modern evolutionists teach that as species spread and became isolated,
natural selection chose the ones with gene mutations that made them capable of
surviving in their new environment. As a result, evolutionists speculate, these
isolated groups eventually developed into totally new species….
Nevertheless, what proof do evolutionists provide to support the claim that
natural selection chooses beneficial mutations to produce new species?
```

This proof
https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/speciation/evidence-for-speciation/
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13285

```
So, does natural selection really create entirely new species? Decades ago, 
evolutionary biologist George Christopher Williams began questioning whether 
natural selection had such power. 
```

And do you know what his conclusion was? That it can. What he questioned was whether natural 
selection happened on the group level and argued that it happens more on the genetic level.
https://www.nature.com/articles/467790a

```
Jeffrey H. Schwartz wrote that natural selection may be helping species adapt to 
the changing demands of existence, but it is not creating anything new.
```

This is a misquote. 
https://archive.org/details/suddenoriginsfos0000schw/page/320/mode/2up?view=theater

Here's the full quote
```
Nonetheless, it is important to realize that if, according to Williams, natural selection strives to maintain stability, then the picture of evolution that emerges is one in which nothing of significance happens until it is dis- rupted by mutation. Natural selection may be accommodating individuals to the vicissitudes of daily existence by choosing among the already available alleles, but it is not creating anything new. This does indeed appear to be what Williams meant...
```

He is not arguing against natural selection, he's saying a certain way of thinking about natural selection may lead to this thinking. He never say anything close to "natural selection can't produce anything new"

```
Myth 3. The fossil record documents macroevolutionary changes. The previously 
mentioned NAS brochure leaves the reader with the impression that the fossils 
found by scientists more than adequately document macroevolution. It declares: 
“So many intermediate forms have been discovered between fish and amphibians, 
between amphibians and reptiles, between reptiles and mammals, and along the 
primate lines of descent that it often is difficult to identify categorically when the transition occurs from one to another particular species.” 

The facts. The confident statement made by the NAS brochure is quite surprising. 
Why? Niles Eldredge, a staunch evolutionist, states that the fossil record shows, not that there is a gradual accumulation of change, but that for long periods of time, “little or no evolutionary change accumulates in most species.”
```


Another case of misquoting. Niles Eldredge here is referring to his theory of punctuated equilibrium.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium
He is in no way saying anything against evolution.

Here's the full quote -[The triumph of evolution : and the failure of creationism-page 49](https://archive.org/details/triumphofevoluti0000eldr/page/n1/mode/2up)
```
Here is another pattern that has great potential significance for understanding hot the evolutionary process works-the subject of the next chapter: during the long intervals of time between enviromental disruption, extintion, and the rapid subsequent development of new speices, ecosystems and species themselves are remarkably stable. Little or no evolutionary change accumulates in most species during these periods of quiescence - a phenomenon not greatly remarked on by biologists until my colleague Stephen Jay Gould and I discussed it in the 1970s, calling it stasis
```


```
To date, scientists worldwide have unearthed and cataloged some 200 million 
large fossils and billions of small fossils. Many researchers agree that this vast 
and detailed record shows that all the major groups of animals appeared 
suddenly and remained virtually unchanged, with many species disappearing as 
suddenly as they arrived
```

“Many Researchers” that we aren’t going to name or give any source for because this statement is a 
straight up lie. 

Here’s a list of scientists who believe in God and Evolution
	• Kenneth Miller
	• Francisco J. Ayala
	• Theodosius Grigorievich Dobzhansky
	• Francis Collins

What an atheistic bias these people must have huh?
Something a lot of creationists like to do is make out like evolution is synonyms with atheism. This is blatantly false. Even if evolution wasn’t true that doesn’t automatically mean creationism is. The default position is “we don’t know” that however does not mean you can put God into whatever gap of knowledge you like. All this to say atheists do not need evolution to be true to not believe in God. On the other hand, to theists who want to believe Adam and Eve is a true story, evolution is a slap in the face. So, who really are the biased ones here?

What is even funnier is how Watchtower doses mention that Wolf-Ekkehard Lönnig who they cited earlier is a Jehovah’s witness https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102006327. Yeah, definitely no bias at all, huh. 

So according to Watchtower another Jehovah’s Witness is an unbiased source but [the vast majority of scientists who accept evolution](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/) are just all biased?

# The Origin of Life—Five Questions Worth Asking
## How Did Life Begin?

First, I’d like to address that how life began has nothing to do with whether evolution is true is not.  Evolution is there to explain the diversity of life, how creatures change and adapt to their environment. It has nothing to with how life began. A magic unicorn could have started life and evolution would still be true. But even if how exactly life begin is unknow doesn’t mean you can just suddenly say it was God and call it a day. That’s not how science works.

```
What do many scientists claim? Many who believe in evolution would tell you 
that billions of years ago, life began on the edge of an ancient tidal pool or deep in the ocean. They feel that in some such location, chemicals spontaneously 
assembled into bubblelike structures, formed complex molecules, and began 
replicating. They believe that all life on earth originated by accident from one or more of these “simple” original cells.
```

No one says it was spontaneous! No one says it was one single act that suddenly turned non-life into life! Abiogenies would have been the result of multiply processes. Watch Tower is simply making up stuff no one is even claiming.

```
“Some writers,” says Robert Shapiro, professor emeritus of chemistry at New York 
University, “have presumed that all life’s building blocks could be formed with 
ease in Miller-type experiments and were present in meteorites. This is not the 
case.
```

Shapiro isn’t arguing that abiogenesis is impossible. Using his word to try and make out like he is, is just dishonest. He has in fact giving his own ideas about how abiogenesis happened. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/10/nyu-chemist-robert-shapiro-decries-rna-firstpossibility/

```
Similarly, if scientists ever did construct a cell, they would accomplish something truly amazing—but would they prove that the cell could be made by accident? If anything, they would prove the very opposite, would they not?
```

Ok, but what if scientists showed all the individual steps that could have happened, in order to piece together how the first cells came about? Showing how it could be possible for cells to come about without any direct intelligence?

## DARWIN’S TREE CHOPPED DOWN

```
What has the research uncovered? In 1999 biologist Malcolm S. Gordon wrote: 
“Life appears to have had many origins. The base of the universal tree of life 
appears not to have been a single root.” Is there evidence that all the major 
branches of life are connected to a single trunk, as Darwin believed? Gordon 
continues: “The traditional version of the theory of common descent apparently 
does not apply to kingdoms as presently recognized. It probably does not apply to 
many, if not all, phyla, and possibly also not to many classes within the phyla.”
```

Gordon is not arguing against evolution he is talking about Horizontal gene transfer.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer

```
This may then facilitate the development of a consensus among evolutionary biologists that will promote improved understanding of both evolutionary process and of actual evolutionary events.

The author’s hope is that this essay may contribute in a small way to
the mitigation of the strong trend toward more and more reductionism that
pervades much of modern biology.
```

Again, another paper about trying to understand evolution better being twisted to make it sound like he’s arguing against it. https://ncse.ngo/malcolm-gordon-0

### WHAT ABOUT THE FOSSIL RECORD?

```
“Instead of finding the gradual unfolding of life,” says evolutionary paleontologist David M. Raup, “what geologists of Darwin’s time, and geologists of the present day actually find is a highly uneven or jerky record; that is, species appear in the sequence very suddenly, show little or no change during their existence in the record, then abruptly go out of the record.”

```

Here’s the actual article: 
https://ia800700.us.archive.org/19/items/cbarchive_36375_conflictsbetweendarwinandpaleo1930/conflictsbetweendarwinandpaleo1930.pdf

Another example of someone writing about understanding evolution better twisted to make it sound like he’s arguing against it. Science is not something set in stone, as we do more research and find new evidence our understand of things grows. No one says Darwin got everything right or he didn’t make mistakes, but our understanding of evolution is now solely based on what Darwin said or wrote. As David Raup puts it “We must distinguish between the fact of evolution – defined as change in organisms over time – and the explanation of this change. Darwin’s contribution, through his theory of natural selection, was to suggest how evolutionary change took place.”

```
In fact, more than half of all the major divisions of animal life seem to have 
appeared in a relatively short period of time. Because many new and distinct life forms appear so suddenly in the fossil record, paleontologists refer to this period as “the Cambrian explosion.” When was the Cambrian period?

Let us assume that the estimates of researchers are accurate. In that case, the 
history of the earth could be represented by a time line that stretches the length of a soccer field (1). At that scale, you would have to walk about seven eighths of the way down the field before you would come to what paleontologists call the Cambrian period (2). During a small segment of that period, the major divisions of animal life show up in the fossil record. How suddenly do they appear? As you walk down the soccer field, all those different creatures pop up in the space of less 
than one step!
```
![football field](https://github.com/Beerman595692/BlogPosts/blob/main/Media/evolution/1102010346_E_cnt_2_xl.jpg?raw=true)

The Cambrian lasted 53.4 million years. All that’s been established here is the earth is really old. The explosion is just the fact that the Cambrian is marked by the emergence of hard body tissue like shells and exoskeletons that can fossilize easier. Though fossils that predate the Cambrian have been discovered. Such as the Stromatolite depicted 
below
 ![Stromatolite](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Stromatolithe_Pal%C3%A9oarch%C3%A9en_-_MNHT.PAL.2009.10.1.jpg/220px-Stromatolithe_Pal%C3%A9oarch%C3%A9en_-_MNHT.PAL.2009.10.1.jpg)
### PROBLEMS WITH THE “PROOF”
```
Henry Gee says: “The intervals of time that separate the fossils are so huge that 
we cannot say anything definite about their possible connection through ancestry 
and descent.”
```

In the footnote of this quote it reads

```
Henry Gee does not suggest that the theory of evolution is wrong. His comments 
are made to show the limits of what can be learned from the fossil record.
```

Hmmm so a guy is saying stuff that supposedly make evolution looks bad but still believes it. Could it be this quote is being taken out of context?

Here's the full quote
```

It is possible, of course, that the fossil really did belong to my lineal ancestor. Everybody has an ancestry, after all. Given what the Leakeys and others have found in East Africa, there is good reason to suspect that hominids lived in the Rift before they lived anywhere else in the world, so all modern humans must derive their ancestry, ultimately, from this spot, or somewhere near it. It is therefore reasonable to sup- pose that we should all be able to trace our ancestries, in a general way, to creatures that lived in the Rift between roughly 5 and 3 million years ago. So much is true, but it is impossible to know, for certain, that the fossil I hold in my hand is my lineal ancestor. Even if it really was my ancestor, I could never know this unless every generation between the fossil and me had preserved some record of its existence and its pedi- gree. The fossil itself is not accompanied by a helpful label. The truth 
is that my own particular ancestry-or yours-may never be recovered from the fossil record.

The obstacle to this certain knowledge about lineal ancestry lies in the extreme sparseness of the fossil record. As noted above, if my mys- tery skull belonged to an extinct giant civet, Pseudocivetta ingens, it would be the oldest known record of this species by a million years. This means that no fossils have been found that record the existence of this species for that entire time; and yet the giant civets must have been there all along. Depending on how old giant civets had to be before they could breed (something else we can never establish, because giant civets no longer exist so that we can watch their behaviour), perhaps a hundred thousand generations lived and died between the fossil found by me at site LO5 and the next oldest specimen. In addition, we cannot know if the fossil found at LO5 was the lineal ancestor of the speci- mens found at Olduvai Gorge or Koobi Fora. It might have been, but we can never know this for certain. The intervals of time that separate the fossils are so huge that we cannot say anything definite about their possible connection through ancestry and descent.
```

He is talking about specific fossil. A Hominid tooth found at site LO5. He’s saying that well it would be impossible to know if that tooth was a direct ancestor of his, but it is possible to tell if they had some relationship with modern day humans. That these relationships may change as new evidence is found.

WHAT DOES THE “FILM” REALLY SHOW?
```
An article published in National Geographic in 2004 likened the fossil record to “a film of evolution from which 999 of every 1,000 frames have been lost on the 
cutting-room floor.” Consider the implications of that illustration.
```

Here's the full quote https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/was-darwin-wrong
```
Like the human hand, an early whale’s front foot (second) retains a five-fingered bone structure; a vestigial rear foot (first) has lost several toe bones, but its very existence testifies to the whale’s descent from a four-legged ancestor. Illuminating but spotty, the fossil record is like a film of evolution from which 999 of every 1,000 frames have been lost on the cutting-room floor. Still, Gingerich and others have found dozens of intermediate forms—missing links that are no longer missing.
```

### FACTS AND QUESTIONS

```
Could this similarity exist, not because they had the same ancestor, but because 
they had the same Designer?
```

No.
Let’s look at the anteaters and aardvarks. These are two animals that eat the same things in the same way in the same environment, only on different continents. If it was common design their genetics would match that design. Yet their genetics matches up with the fossil record where aardvark are shown to have a common ancestor with elephants and golden moles.

Secondly common ancestry is variable, falsifiable and makes predictions. It is every a scientific claim should be. Common design is none of that, it is no scientific, it just a way for creationist to cope with the fact their ideas are completely baseless.

### What about Human evolution

```
Answer: No. In fact, the opposite is true. When it comes to how these fossils 
should be classified, Robin Derricourt of the University of New South Wales, 
Australia, wrote in 2009: “Perhaps the only consensus now is that there is no 
consensus.” In 2007 the science journal Nature published an article by the 
discoverers of another claimed link in the evolutionary tree, saying that nothing is known about when or how the human line actually emerged from that of apes.41 Gyula Gyenis, a researcher at the Department of Biological Anthropology, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary, wrote in 2002: “The classification and the 
evolutionary place of hominid fossils has been under constant debate.” * This 
author also states that the fossil evidence gathered so far brings us no closer to knowing exactly when, where, or how humans evolved from apelike creatures.
```

These debates most of the time just about fine details. When classifying stuff in biology is important to remember that all classification are human constructs and nature dose not always fit stuff into nice, neat boxes. This constant debate is just how science is supposed to work. It’s not “human’s evolving from apes is all a lie” as watchtower makes it out to be.

# Common Arguments Against Evolution

## Why are there still monkeys?

If when you hear evolution the image that comes to mind is the famous March of Progress by Rudolph Zallinger then your understanding of evolution is flawed. Evolution is not a straightforward linier thing. It’s a tree, though would even say it’s more 
of a web. But if you think about a family tree, you have 
siblings who lineages split off from your own. This is why 
Chimps are call our cousins, we didn’t evolve from them, 
we share a common ancestor with them

## Hebrews 3:4

```
Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed 
all things is God
```

You think houses we have today are the same as the house we had 100 or even 1,000 years ago? As time went how houses were built were changed and improved, or another way to put it, houses evolved. The difference is where houses need people to build new houses, living organisms can have children whose DNA and change and mutate on its own.

The teleological argument commits the apples and oranges fallacy, thinking that because life and things humans make are complex, they both must have come about the same way. Ignoring any differences, the two have. And frankly this argument is so old and overused and people who use it act like no one else has thought about it before. As if no evolutionary biologist has never heard it 
before.

## Fine tuning

“The Earth is perfect for life; it must have been designed for it”.

Douglas Adams came up with the puddle analogy.
```
If you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an 
interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!
```

The Earth was not created for life. Life adapted to live on the earth. To a camel the artic is an inhospitable place for life, to a polar bear the desert is an inhospitable place for life. In much the same way, as far as we know, there could be planets that are inhospitable to life on Earth yet has life on it. And to the life on these planets Earth is inhospitable to them. 

“But the chances of…”

Let’s say you have some buttons and a 1/1000 chance of at least of those buttons being red. If you had 1000 buttons at least one of them will be red.

The universe is huge, with more planets than we can count. You can argue the chances of the Earth being the exact way it is are as low as you want. But when you have a sample size of basically infinity of course you are going to get a planet like Earth.

## Boeing 747
“Evolution is like a tornado ripping through a barn and producing a Boeing 747”
Except evolution is nothing like. There’s a reason it’s called evolution and not “things randomly slapping themselves together ion.” 
While mutations are random, evolution as a whole is not. Natural selection selects traits that help an organism survive.

## Irreducible Complexity
The was an argument invented by Micheal Behe which that if a component of biological structure was removed it would no longer be able to perform a function.
People have pointed out to Behe however that this misunderstands evolution. A structure may not be able to perform its present function, but it can still perform a different function. Evolution prefers to modify what is already there than making entire new structures.

## This “Expert” says.
You may think that section on JW.org that promotes people who believe creation means creationism is just as scientific as evolution, but in fact that section mean absolutely nothing.
Science is not “this person said this” Science is based on evidence and research, something evolution has tones of, and creationism has none of.

It’s a tactic used climate change deniers and alternative medicine peddlers to try a use what called an appeal to authority argument to make it seem like they aren’t anti-science when they most definitely are.

This is why you don’t look at what one or two or even a handful of scientists say, you look at the scientific consensus.

## Thing only evolution within kinds

What is a kind?

Many creationist argue that thing evolve but only up to a certain point, yet can not agree where exactly that point is. 

It get even more ridiculous when you factor in Noah's ark. As many creationist claim Noah only had to take in a limited number of kinds to get the creatures we have today. As the Insight book claims `43 “kinds” of mammals, 74 “kinds” of birds, and 10 “kinds” of reptiles in the ark`. Meaning somehow millions of years of evolution somehow happened in just 4000 years.

Another thing is how they try to claim humans are their own kind. Chimps and Bonobos  are a lot closer to humans than they are other ape species like gorillas and orangutans. To class them as apes but not humans is ridiculous.

# Why we know Adam and Eve is false.

You think may because the Bible talks about real king, places and events in some books that means 
the entire is true. However, such black and white thinking can cloud one’s judgement. Ancient people 
did not sperate categories of fiction and non-fiction. The two would often be blended together.
The Adam and Story however is 100% myth. This is not a matter of belief if you accept the evidence.
Even if evolution is wrong, there is still no evidence to Adam and Eve being right.
The biggest blow to this myth is the date the watchtower says Adam and Eve left the garden being 
4026 B.C.E

![Adam and Eve](https://github.com/Beerman595692/BlogPosts/blob/main/Media/evolution/Pasted%20image%2020250110232118.png?raw=true)

In the November Broadcast of 2017 David Splaine quotes the Smithsonian about the when the Sphinx constructed around 2550 B.C.E. He says the quote is wrong because it contradicts their date for the flood. This an organization that will straight up ignore archaeological evidence if contradicts their beliefs.

So, they will gladly put Adam and Eve around 4026 B.C.E despite mountains of evidence to show humans have been around way longer than that. 
I will now present this evidence.

Humans have been around for at least 100s of thousands of years. To reduce that number to 6,000 years is just absurd. 

Though watchtower has tried in [the Insight Book they claim](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000970?q=the+thousands+years+of+%22prehistory%22&p=par)

```
The thousands of years of “prehistory” they argue for are dependent on speculation, as can be seen from this statement by prominent scientist P. E. Klopsteg, who stated: “Come, now, if you will, on a _speculative_ excursion into prehistory. _Assume_ the era in which the species sapiens emerged from the genus Homo . . . hasten across the millenniums for which present information depends for the most part on _conjecture_ and _interpretation_ to the era of the first inscribed records, from which some facts may be gleaned.” (Italics ours.)​—_Science,_ December 30, 1960, p. 1914.
