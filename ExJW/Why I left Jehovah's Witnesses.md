I was raised a Jehovah's Witnesses. I went to meetings, I preached and I truly believed all of it. I even got baptised. But during lock down things would change.

I watch a lot of educational and science based youtube channels such as [Scishow](https://www.youtube.com/@SciShow) and [Ted-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/@TEDEd). One video that got me was a [TED-Ed video on cults](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB-dJaCXAxA), a lot in the video resonated with me. Perceptually the bit about targeting people who have experienced the lose of a loved one, and how we have magazines specifically targeted at such people. It wasn't enough to make me lose my faith but it did spark something. I also watch this [video by TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaUhR-tRkHY) , him talking about how cults talk about apostates really struck how much this sounded like Jehovah's Wittnesses. I didn't want to believe I was in a cult, but things started to feel off. I watch a lot of videos as well of people such as [ScimanDan](https://www.youtube.com/@SciManDan) and [Professor Dave ](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorDaveExplains) debunking flatearthers. When they played clips of flatearthers talking about the globe earth, it really sounded to me exactly like how Watchtower talks about Evolution.

During one family study we saw one of the "was it designed" articles on jw.org. I started to think to myself "why don't scientist who study this stuff believe in creation if there's so much evidence for it?" My dads answer to this is that they just don't want to believe in god, even though there are people who believe in both. 

I made an effort to learn about evolution and could see the arguments Watchtower made against it were pretty bad. Especially "this thing complex there it had to be designed." Like, We have languages with complex grammatical rules, no one designed English, it evolved over time use the exact same principles described by Darwin. We have used these same principles to develop complex AI. To claim evolution can't produce complexity is dumb. 

As well as the argument that "there of 1 in 1,000,000 chance of the earth being the way it is." If there was a 1 in 1,000 chance of there being a red button and you had 1,000 buttons at least one of them is going to be red. The universe is freaking huge, we don't even know how big it is. With such a large sample size, I think the Earth being the way it is an statistical inevitability.

Well my parent thing "why are there still monkeys?" is a good argument, my brother at least knew a bit about evolution so I ask him stuff and he said "If evolution was true it would mean animals being born with different number of chromosome and therefore downs syndrome." Which isn't exactly how downs syndrome works. Turns out biology is a lot more complicated than what you learn in high school. [I'll let this reddit thread answer this one. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/pgr53w/my_brother_told_me_evolution_could_have_happened/)

My parents brought in an old guy who apparently used to believe in evolution and he told me "if evolution was true, why are there still monkeys?" So I knew this was a waste of time. They then brought along a woman who used to be in my congregation who studied molecular biology. Her arguments was basically Darwinian Natural Selection and Mendelian inheritance had some conflict until modern synthesis brought them together. Which is just how science works. She also told me to read a book by Micheal Behe who I learnt is a complete charlatan. My dad also try to tell me that evolution can't explain why we have the diversity of life we have today, even though that literally what evolution is there to explain.

While researching evolution, my parents ask my brother to change the wifi password to stop me from looking at stuff (even though I didn't look at anything apostate). But I got back in to it anyway. 

We also watched the film made my watchtower "The Wonders of Creation Reveal Godâ€™s Glory" a film that's just stupid arguments and animal stock footage set to whimsical music.

Eventually I said fuck it and start to secretly watch Apostate videos such as Lloyd Evans (who is an asshole now), Altworldly and ExJW Caleb and joined [r/exJW](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/top/). I learnt about how Watchtower lies about 1914 and 607. 

I remember my dad being like "See the bible named a real place, see how accurate it is" I responded with "Well spider-man takes place in new york, new york is a real place, therefore spider-man is real" which he got really mad at me saying. I watched [Usefulcharts "who wrote the bible"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY-l0X7yGY0&list=PLY24TzULtd7Rs1oEXQyDrqNV2PG7Y5Rpz) series and learnt the real history about the bible and how it doesn't 100% line up with historical findings. 

Another Issue that got me was the Child abuse within the organisation. My parents would gladly watch documentaries about child abuse in other religions such one about the Church of England. Where they would make comments like "how could anyone join that religions when all this happened in it." But when came to documentaries or news report about it happening with Jehovah's Witnesses suddenly it's "that's just apostate lies and misinformation" and "they don't present the full facts." Their are plenty of cases out there of people who were abused and disfellowshipped for calling the police meanwhile the abuser was made an elder.

# How I finally left

Eventually it was time for Jehovah's Witnesses to have their conventions, ironically about building your faith, although since it was during lock down it was a prerecorded video rather than live talks. We watch the first part of the convention where we saw video of a guy explain why he doesn't believe in evolution. A guy with a degree in engineering not biology. He claims there no way the eye could evolve, then briefly mentions the idea of how the eye could have evolved from photosensitive cells to which his rebuttal to it was that he just didn't agree with it. Because apparently all of science hinges on what this one guy thinks.

We also had a reading of the Noah's Ark account in Genesis, which open with former governing body member Anthony Morris saying that we know the flood was a real event because other people in the bible reference it.

The following week, my parents came into my room to tell me their were going to watch the second part of the convention. I announced to them I was done, finished, kaput. I no longer what to be a Jehovah's Wittiness any more. My mom tried to ask me to give them six months to get me back, but I was refused. I was finished.

# What do I think of religion?
I had a lot of kids in my class who were ultra atheist. Claiming that religion holds humanity back and without it we'd already live in some star trekian society with flying cars and robot butlers. Which I find to be a very big over simplification of how progress works. And I've seen prominent atheists like Richard Dawkins claim that religion causes people to fly into buildings, reducing all the complicated history that led to the problems we have in the middle east today down to "because they believe in god" or what he really means "because they're Muslim" as his comments "\[Chrisitanity\] seems to me to be a fundamentally decent religion, in a way that I think Islam is not" showing that this way of thinking leads to the rise in Islamophobia we see today. As an ExJW I fully support Ex members of any religion including Islam and don't think any belief system is above criticism. But a lot of these new Atheists will gladly talk about how religion causes war while clearly choosing a side of said religious wars.

Personally, I don't believe in anything super natural or superstitious. I don't care if other people do, to each their own. But will not stand for any belief system that spreads hate, lies, denies scientific evidence, exploits people or abuses people.

If you are part of a group that

* Demonises outsiders

* Demands complete obedience

* Demands your life fit around the group

You're in a cult, Get Out!
