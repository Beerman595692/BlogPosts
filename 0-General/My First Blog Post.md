# My First Post

This is the first post I'm making one this blog. I made this blog in order right about stuff I'm passionate about and give my thoughts. 

## Introductions
Hi I'm Beerman595692 a crazy brit who's currently learning cyber security hoping to get a job as a ethical hacker, but even if I don't it can give me the knowledge to get other jobs in IT.

My hobbies include programming, anime/cartoons, 3D printing and tinkering. Basically a lot of nerdy stuff.
