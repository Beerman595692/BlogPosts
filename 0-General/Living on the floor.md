About a month ago I saw some videos by a Channel called [Movementum](https://www.youtube.com/@Movementum) which introduced me to the concept of furniture free. And a lot of it made sense. He talked about giving up furniture and doing most of daily tasks on the floor. The logic being that in a chair on meant to sit in one position. Feet on floor, back straight, arms at a 90 degree angle. But when sit in a chair, I just want to slouch and put my feet on the desk. I one of the reason for my mouseless setup was so I could mount my split keyboard to my arm rests so I could lean back in my chair and not have to reach my desk. But every so often you have to get up and move around, as recommended by health experts, because our bodies aren't made to stay in one position for long periods of time. Even if you sit with perfect posture your muscles will feel sore. Because you are made to move. On the floor you can sit in any position you wish and if one position is starting to feel uncomfortable, you can move to another. There is no correct way to sit.

This lead me to reconfigure my desk arrangement. 

I have gotten this floor to standing desk by [Lowdesk](https://lowdesk.com/products/2-leg-desk). However, I do not have Â£1,000 for a desk. So I decided to just use what I had. And what I had was a simple Ikea desk which I could remove the top of and add longer legs to it. So I could make a double decker desk, with one monitor on top and one below. With both monitors mirroring each other. Allowing me to sit and stand as I like. Also this split wireless keyboard I have gives me a lot of flexablity to how I sit. 

Months later and definitly feel more flexible and way less back pain. It's made me realise just how uncomfortable chairs really are for me. I always end up in weird position in a chair to try and get comfortable. On the floor, there is no weird positions. Just don't stay in one for too long. I just feel way more comfortable on the floor.

# Giving up my bed
So I gave up my bed for a futon. I was a bit uncomfortable at first, but after a while you get used to it and can sleep on it just as comfortably as with a regular mattress.

This has opened up plenty of space in my room to be used for different purposes. I was quite fasinated with space saving furniture. Seeing vidoes online of folding furniture and furniture and can morph into different configurations. Allowing a single room to have multiple uses. But going furniture free, I don't need folding furniture. I can put an exercise mat down and do all kinds of exercises with all the space.

People have claimed that sleeping on a floor is better for your back. While I'm no medical expert, what I've gathered is that studies on this seem to pretty mixed. It is possible for your mattress to be too soft. This can lead to your spine curling in while you sleep. Ideally you want your spine to be straight while you sleep. But if you suffer from back pain, see a doctor instead of listening to some person on the internet telling you to sleep on the floor. Just because some people claim it works for them dosen't mean it'll necessarily work for you.

Saying that, I have found sitting and sleeping on the floor very comfortable and has given me freedom in how I sit and use my space. For anyone thinking about going furniture free, I'd say take it slow. Don't just throw away all your furniture at once. Just start by sitting on the floor more and slowly figure out what works for you.
