# My Linux Journey
About a year ago I ditch windows and embraced the linux life.
I started off by installing [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) on an old laptop I had to first dip my toes into linux. It's a good beginner friendly that's meant for people coming from windows in to get used to linux but runs a bit slow. I was then recommend [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) a fedora based distro focused on gaming.

I then started my distro hoping phases. First trying out [Open Suse](https://www.opensuse.org/) but it ran pretty slow so I ran another Distro call [Regata](https://get.regataos.com.br/) another gaming distro based on Open Suse. and Finally an [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) based distro called [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/).

I tried all these distro while I had an NVIDIA graphics card, which is a pain for Linux due to their lack of open source drivers. While there are distros that come pre-installed with NVIDIA gpu drivers, the gpu I had a DVI port which one of my monitors was connected to through a HDMI adaptor. Turns out the lastest NVIDIA drivers for linux have problems with DVI, so I had to try and downgrade the drivers to get the monitor to work. This let to other problems and was such a headache I just switch to an AMD system.

The current system I have settled on is that I now duel boot with Nobara for gaming and Arch for programming.
