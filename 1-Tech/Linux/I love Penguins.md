# My Linux Journey

About a year ago I ditch windows and embraced the linux life.
I started off by installing [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) on an old laptop I had to first dip my toes into linux. It's a good beginner friendly that's meant for people coming from windows in to get used to linux but runs a bit slow. I was then recommend [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) a fedora based distro focused on gaming.

I then started my distro hoping phases. First trying out [Open Suse](https://www.opensuse.org/) but it ran pretty slow so I ran another Distro call [Regata](https://get.regataos.com.br/) another gaming distro based on Open Suse. and Finally an [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) based distro called [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/).

I tried all these distro while I had an NVIDIA graphics card, which is a pain for Linux due to their lack of open source drivers. While there are distros that come pre-installed with NVIDIA gpu drivers, the gpu I had a DVI port which one of my monitors was connected to through a HDMI adaptor. Turns out the latest NVIDIA drivers for linux have problems with DVI, so I had to try and downgrade the drivers to get the monitor to work. This let to other problems and was such a headache I just switch to an AMD system.

The current system I have settled on is that I now duel boot with Nobara for gaming and Arch for programming. 

# Why I like Linux and FOSS

Big tech companies are well know for selling your data to advertisers, locking down their systems and pushing useless AI features no one asked for.

When I switch to linux, I truly felt like my computer was my own. The customizability of linux is amazing. I mainly use KDE plasma but you can install any desktop environment you want that all have their own quirks and features. You can make your desktop look and behave how ever you want. 

For software the biggest hurdle for me was Fusion 360, which I use for 3D modelling stuff to 3D print. I tried using WINE and Bottles and Lutris but it was such a hassle I just decided to use freeCAD instead. I find Fusion just works, whereas FreeCAD after I make a sketch getting it to not throw up error can be quite a headache. If you have a piece of software you use on Windows that doesn't support Linux, sure there's WINE, but you'll have a way better time find using FOSS alternatives to that software than getting it to run on Linux.

Sure with Windows and proprietary software, it just works out of the box. But FOSS it's made by the community for the community. No big tech trying to please share holders, including new bullshit AI features no one asked for. Just people wanting to make software for other people to use.

Also, I definitely feel like since I switch to linux I rediscovered my love of computing. The computer I currently have is my computer, not microsoft's or apple's or google's, mine. No forcing me to update or bloatware either. What's on my computer is only there because I want it to be. Whereas with windows, good luck uninstalling Edge.

# Should you switch to linux?

Yes. Don't let big tech giants win. Take back your machines and make them your own.

Don't worry about not being a massive computer nerd. There are beginner friendly distros like Mint. There is plenty of FOSS out there that can replace whatever propitiatory software you currently use.
